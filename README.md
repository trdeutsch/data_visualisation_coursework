The transfer fee of players is an exciting field for analysis from the perspective of team performance in football. Tomkins et al. (2010) state that they have found a significant connection between transfer fees and success. That can explain why the owners of clubs located in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and America immediately think that spending money will lead to success (Brandon, 2024). That thought is not entirely unreasonable. Merten (2022) determines that believing in the traditional knowledge that increased transfer fees correlate to better performance is accurate. Moreover, clubs need to maintain a high transfer fee in the long term to influence future performance, and high transfer fees cannot influence performance in the short term. Therefore, they cannot be expected to influence performance in the long term. 

This project aims to expand upon the INF6027 finding, which suggests that maintaining high transfer fees over the long term is essential for influencing future performance, by exploring two examples: Manchester City Football Club, which retains its transfer fees over the long term, and Chelsea Football Club, which tends to invest in high transfers in the short term. Moreover, it will look at another important aspect that improves the team's performance: how well the club can invest wisely in the right players who enhance team performance directly.

Analyzing the project provides some insights:

1. During the 2012 to 2022 period, Manchester City spent more than Chelsea in six out of eleven seasons, while Chelsea spent more in five seasons. This result indicates that Manchester City has held higher transfer fees in the long term than Chelsea, ultimately influencing their performance in 2023.
2. It shows that Manchester City achieved ten more wins than Chelsea, despite Chelsea spending almost twice as much on transfer fees.
3. Another factor contributing to Manchester City's more tremendous success over Chelsea is their ability to invest wisely in the right players, directly enhancing team performance. While Manchester City spends more on attackers, Chelsea's cost per minute for that position is greater than Manchester City's.
